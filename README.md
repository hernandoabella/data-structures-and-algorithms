## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms guide! This document provides an overview of fundamental data structures and algorithms, essential for efficient problem-solving in software development.

## Data Structures

### Arrays

Arrays are a collection of elements identified by index or key. They are one of the simplest and most commonly used data structures.

### Linked Lists

Linked Lists consist of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

### Stacks

Stacks are collections that follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. The most recently added element is removed first.

### Queues

Queues are collections that follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. The earliest added element is removed first.

### Hash Tables

Hash Tables store key-value pairs. They use a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

### Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node and children nodes forming a parent-child relationship.

### Graphs

Graphs consist of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. They can represent various networks like social networks, communication networks, etc.

### Heaps

Heaps are specialized tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property. They are commonly used in implementing priority queues.

### Tries

Tries (prefix trees) are a type of search tree used to store associative arrays where keys are usually strings.

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms

#### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

#### Selection Sort

Selection Sort divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items and a sublist of the remaining items.

#### Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

#### Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the list into equal halves and merges them in a sorted manner.

#### Quick Sort

Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot.

### Searching Algorithms

#### Linear Search

Linear Search sequentially checks each element of the list until the target value is found.

#### Binary Search

Binary Search is a more efficient algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

### Graph Algorithms

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

#### Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

#### Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

#### A* Algorithm

A* Algorithm is an extension of Dijkstra's Algorithm that uses heuristics to improve performance.

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

### Greedy Algorithms

Greedy Algorithms build up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit.

### Backtracking

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally.

## Big O Notation

Big O Notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

## Common Problems and Solutions

Explore common algorithmic problems and their solutions, such as the Fibonacci sequence, sorting problems, and pathfinding.

## Best Practices

- Understand the problem before you start coding.
- Choose the right data structure for the task.
- Consider time and space complexity.
- Write clean and readable code.
- Test your algorithms thoroughly.
